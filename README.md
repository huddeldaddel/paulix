# Paulix

Paulix is a simple JavaScript based Jump And Run game, written for and dedicated to Paula and Felix Werner.

The project uses Node.js and React. To start hacking the game (e.g. to add new levels) you need to:

*   Install a local Node.js
*   Install Gulp (globally) and Gulp-Cli
*   Install a webserver
*   Run "npm install" to install the required node packages
*   Run "gulp" to build the app
*   Start the webserver

Have fun :)
